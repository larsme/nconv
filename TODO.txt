- Channel before spatial (so there are 2 spatial convs in layer 1)
- Symmetric Spatial Wheights
	Assuming only directionless channels (since there are only 2 channels & depth is directionless):
	a b a
	c d c
	e f e
- ones
	center pixel in spatial conv
	weight from channel 2 to channel 2 in channelwise conv
- deeper network if there are still places with cd = 0 at the end (there are in own dataet, maybe not in kitti)
	alternatively
	- "bias"
		learned d, cd for cd = 0
		1 value "constant" respectively => learned values at output
	other options are possible (e.g. approx plane / LS with approx values for polinomial at output / ...)
- structnconv
	search structnconv_s_simple for errors, if there are none, test arg max(s/d+eps) or somethin similar in addition to nconv for spatial convolution
	if stable solution exists, use simple guided net (edge detector -> s0), expand from there
